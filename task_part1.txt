#Task:
Write a simple function that checks whether a given string is a **palindrome**.  

##Definition:
A palindrome is a word that reads the same backward as forward

For example:  
- "racecar" and "madam" is a palindrome.  
- "Hello" and "World" is not a palindrome.  

The function should return True if the string is a palindrome and False otherwise.

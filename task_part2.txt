Extend the task with advanced version allowing phrases or sequence.

##Definition:
A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward when:  
1. Non-alphabetic characters are ignored.  
2. Capitalization is normalized (treated as lowercase).  

For example:  
- "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama" is a palindrome.  
- "Hello, World!" is not a palindrome.  

The function should return `True` if the string is a palindrome and `False` otherwise.
